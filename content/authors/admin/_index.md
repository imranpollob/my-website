I am <b>Imran Pollob</b> from Bangladesh. I have completed my Bachelorâ€™s and Mastersâ€™s degrees in Information Technology from Jahangirnagar University, which is one of the top public universities in my country. Currently, I am working as a Fullstack Software Engineer for more than 4 years. At my current workspace, my job responsibility is to gather renewable energy data from various sources, preprocess, classify and store it on the cloud for further data analysis to predict future energy data.

I always wondered how the prediction works almost perfectly and from curiosity, I started learning about Machine Learning specifically Deep Learning and that decision changed my career entirely. Currently, learning and learning to make myself competent for the ML field. Oh snap! it has no learning boundary ðŸ™ƒ.
