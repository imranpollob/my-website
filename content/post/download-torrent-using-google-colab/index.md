### Notes

#### Google Colab files are temporary

One important caveat to remember while using Colab is that the files you upload to it wonâ€™t be available forever. Colab is a temporary environment with an idle timeout of 90 minutes and an absolute timeout of 12 hours. This means that the runtime will disconnect if it has remained idle for 90 minutes, or if it has been in use for 12 hours. On disconnection, you lose all your variables, states, installed packages, and files and will be connected to an entirely new and clean environment on reconnecting.

#### Increase colab disk space

Google Colab gives 80GB space by default. But if you need more space around 350GB then click Runtime -> Change runtime type and give GPU as the Hardware Accelerator.
