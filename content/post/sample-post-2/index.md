## Overview

1. The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3.

* **Multi-language** - 34+ language packs including English, ‰∏≠Êñá, and Portugu√™s
* **Multi-user** - Each author gets their own profile page
* **Privacy Pack** - Assists with GDPR
* **Stand Out** - Bring your site to life with animation, parallax backgrounds, and scroll effects
* **One-Click Deployment** - No servers. No databases. Only files.

## Themes

Wowchemy and its templates come with **automatic day (light) and night (dark) mode** built-in. Alternatively, visitors can choose their preferred mode - click the moon icon in the top right of the [Demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/) to see it in action! Day/night mode can also be disabled by the site admin in `params.toml`.

[Choose a stunning **theme** and **font**](https://wowchemy.com/docs/customization) for your site. Themes are fully customizable.
